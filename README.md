# Identity-based smart contract authorization

**Power your smart contracts with identity verification â€” without needing to access or manage personal data.**

Authorize transactions based on verified user uniqueness, reputation, and KYC/AML status:
* enable truly democratic governance with one-person-one vote;
* distribute airdrops fairly and avoid bot attacks;
* let artists autograph their NFTs to prove their authenticity;
* bring sybil-resistance to quadratic voting;
* unlock undercollateralized loans;
* ensure KYC/AML regulatory compliance.

Identity is how we get adoption. Early adopters take many risks, but most people are looking for a middle ground between the safe walled garden of Coinbase, and the wild west of liquidity farming. Making identity simple and secure is how we bring the next billion people into crypto and how we persuade institutions to deploy trillions of dollars of liquidity.

## DID Registry Lookup

**Authorize transactions by looking up their sender on Fractal's DID registry.**

### Interface

* `getFractalId(address) -> bytes32 fractalId`
    * Returns the `fractalId` for a given wallet `address`.
    * Each `fractalId` corresponds to a unique human, with one or more associated `address`es.
* `isUserInList(bytes32 fractaId, string listId) -> bool presence`
    * Returns `true` if the given `fractalId` is present in `listId`.
    * KYC level `listId`s: `basic`, `light` and `plus`.
    * Residency `listId`s: `residency_<country code>` (one list for every country; [ISO_3166-1_alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country codes).

### Setup

1. Import our `FractalRegistry.sol` contract and set its address.
1. Adapt the `requiresRegistry` `modifier` based on your KYC level and country requirements.

```solidity
import {FractalRegistry} from "github.com/trustfractal/web3-identity/FractalRegistry.sol";

contract Main {
    address public registryAddress = 0x38cB7800C3Fddb8dda074C1c650A155154924C73;

    modifier requiresRegistry(
        string memory allowedLevel,
        string[3] memory blockedCountries
    ) {
        bytes32 fractalId = FractalRegistry(registryAddress).getFractalId(msg.sender);
        require(fractalId != 0);
        
        require(FractalRegistry(registryAddress).isUserInList(fractalId, allowedLevel));

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < blockedCountries.length; i++) {
            string memory list = string(abi.encodePacked("residency_", blockedCountries[i]));
            require(!FractalRegistry(registryAddress).isUserInList(fractalId, list));
        }

        _;
    }

    function main() external requiresRegistry("plus", ["ca", "de", "us"]) {
        /* your transaction logic goes here */
    }
}
```

### Usage

You're all set: no further steps are required. Fractal keeps the DID Registry up to date.

### Gas cost

The example above adds approximately 26k gas to the transaction cost. Gas usage increases with the number of lookups.

## Credential Verification

**Authorize transactions by including a Fractal signature in their payload.**

### Setup

1. Import our `CredentialVerifier.sol` contract to inherit its `requiresCredential` modifier.
1. Change the first argument of `requiresCredential` based on your KYC level and country requirements.
    * Format: `<kycLevel>;not:<comma-separated country codes>` ([ISO_3166-1_alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country codes).

```solidity
import "github.com/trustfractal/web3-identity/CredentialVerifier.sol";

contract Main is CredentialVerifier {
    function main(
        uint validUntil,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external requiresCredential("plus;not:ca,de,us", validUntil, signature) {
        /* your transaction logic goes here */
    }
}
```

### Usage

1. Before a user interacts with your contract, ask them to sign a message authorizing Fractal to respond on their behalf.
1. Send this message and signature to Fractal's API, which returns an expiry timestamp (24 hours in the future) and a proof (Fractal's signature of the user's credential).
1. Use this timestamp and proof as arguments to your contract's method.

```javascript
const message = "I authorize you to get a proof from Fractal that I passed KYC level plus, and am not a resident of the following countries: CA, DE, US";
const signature = await ethereum.request({method: "personal_sign", params: [message, account]});

const { validUntil, proof } = await FractalAPI.getProof(signature);

mainContract.methods.main(validUntil, proof).send({ from: account });
```

### Gas cost

Credential verification adds approximately 26k gas to the transaction cost.
